# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Overview of the Project

The project aims to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Also, it is going to be used by the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.Â 

I will oversample the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. The SMOTEENN algorithm will then be used in a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling.

Then, to predict credit risk, I will compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. When I'm finished, I'll assess the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results

Here is a comparison of how different classifiers predict credit risk.
